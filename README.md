# Fun with React

Fun with React is my attempt at learning some React basics by implementing 10
popular simple apps like tic-tac-toe or Wordle.

Check out a live version here: https://nate-h.github.io/fun-with-react

Examples:

- [*] card: every example uses the same card component
- [*] tic-tac-toe
- [ ] stop watch
- [ ] use dictionary api to show info on words
- [ ] use public dog api to display cute pics of dogs
- [ ] calculator
- [ ] card memory game
- [ ] todo-list
- [ ] wordle
- [ ] hangman
- [ ] image manipulator
- [ ] drawing app
- [ ] modal

## Commands

```sh
npm start # Runs app in development mode at http://localhost:3000
npm test
npm run build # Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages" # Update github pages
```
